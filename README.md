# Gip Game

**Gip Game** is a game based on Pig - a game involving a 6 sided die, it is a two player game and both players start with 0 points.

The core concept of the game is that a player must roll a 6 sided die and if the number that they roll is greater than 1, then they add that number to their overall score, the player then has a choice to continue playing. If they choose to stop, the total number of accumulated points for the round is added to their overall score and the other player gets a chance to play. 

Otherwise, they can continue playing. But be wary -  if a player rolls a 1 all points that were gathered during their round is lost.

The first player to reach **100** points wins the game.
